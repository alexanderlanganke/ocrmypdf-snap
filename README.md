# ocrmypdf
I use James R. Barlow's OCRmyPDF heavily in my paperless Office and have created this snap for convenience.

# Installation
You can find ocrmypdf on pypi.
There is also a snap package on snapcraft.io:  
[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/ocrmypdf)

or you can get if from the commandline:
<code>sudo snap install ocrmypdf</code>
